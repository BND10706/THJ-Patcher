Notes:
I based this UI on the "Defiance" ROF2 UI I found on EQInterface.com. I didn't like a lot of the custom windows, but I really liked the theme and how crisp it made everything.
I ended up ripping out 95% of everything and rewriting every other window for my own personal likings. This UI was developed primarily for people running on 4k monitors, or
for individuals with terrible eyesight and hate the tiny text/interfaces everywhere. :)
